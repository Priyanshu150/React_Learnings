# React + Vite

A to do list project :- 

Where simply you can add a task to list.
To add a task fill the input area and press add to add that task to list of task.
Delete the task once it's completed just by clicking on the task

The difference between this one and previous version of to do list is that we're removing the task from the array 
And also we're segregating the functionality based on components
